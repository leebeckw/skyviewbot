# skyviewbot

simple [twitter bot](https://twitter.com/skyviewbot) posting (mostly) skies from google street view. note: automated using cron on my personal laptop, so it only posts when my computer is (1) awake and (2) connected to the internet.

check out [this article](https://youareheregeography.com/queer-ecologies/atmospheres/google-sky-view/) in _you are here: the journal of creative geography_ for more about the bot and my motivations for creating it!

- all requirements are in [skyviewbot-reqs.yml](/skyviewbot-reqs.yml)
- bounding boxes from [here](https://github.com/sandstrom/country-bounding-boxes)
- a few code snippets from [here](https://github.com/fitnr/everylotbot)

might be adding some reverse geocoding in the coming months...stay tuned ;)
